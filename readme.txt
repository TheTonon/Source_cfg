To use the CFGs copy text content to a txt file and rename it to autoexec.cfg. Move it to /steam/appdata/common/dota 2 beta/dota/cfg

Or save it as you wish(name.cfg) and use exec file at Console.

Same thing to TF2, but use /steam/appdata/your_account/team fortress 2/tf/cfg instead.

Or you can use alternative link at subfolder readme.
